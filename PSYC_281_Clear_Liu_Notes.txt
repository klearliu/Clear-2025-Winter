Methoed of Research in Psychology

Plato
"Everything we know is inborn (nativist/nature perspective)"

Aristotle
"Knowledge is acquired through experience (empiricist/nurutre perspective)"

    Four Laws of Association:
    1) Law of Similarity: Connect things that are alike
        (ex. thinking of a cat when we see a lion).
    2) Law of Contrast: Thoughts of one extreme lead to thoughts of its opposite
        (ex. white leads to black).
    3) Law of Contiguity: We link things that happen close together in time or space
        (ex. lightning strike and hearing thunder soon after).
    4) Law of Frequency: The more often two things occur together, the stronger their association
        (ex. two people being together leads to them being close).

Descartes
"Human behaviour are not governed by free-will or reason"
Mind-Body (Cartesian) Dualism
    Mind: Voluntary behaviour
    Body: Involuntary behaviour (injury causes a reaction w/o will)
Only humans have a mind

British Empiricists avocated that all knowledge is due to experience:
    John Locke:
        All ideas are acquired through experience, haphazardly
        Humans are born Tabula Rasa; a clean slate

Structuralism: First scientific study of human experience
    Edward B. Titchener
        Studied the basic elements of conscious experience through a technique called introspection

Funtionalism: Psychology should study the adaptive processes of the mind (asking why)
    William James
        Based on Darwin's theory of evolution
        Study of non-human animals encouraged to give insight into human behaviour

Theory of Evolution
    Provides how changes occur in a species across generations through Natural Selection
    Difference between humans and non-human animals seen as one of degree, not kind.

Behaviourism
    John Watson
        Natural science approach and emphasises the study of environmental influences on observable behaviour
        Psychology should only focus on observables

S-R Theory: Learning involves attaching specific responses to specific stimuli in evnvironment
Behaviour Analyst: basic principles of behaviour
Applied behaviour analyst: applies basic principles to developing better metheods

The Five Schools of Behaviourism
    1) Watson's Methodological Behaviourism
        Mechanistic (molecular) theory of Behaviourism
            An envioronmental event (stimulus) and specific behaviour (response)
        Psychologists should only study environmental influences on behaviours that can be directly observed
        EX: A rat is shocked, so it will try to avoid that area.
    2) Hull's Neobehaviourism
        Intervening variables influence behaviour (feelings influencing behaviour) also molecular
        Internal states like current status alters observable behaviour
        EX: A hungry rat performs differently in a maze than a non-hungry one.
        These things must be objectively identified, so you cannot say the rat is hungry, but can say the rat hasn't
        eaten in 5 days.
    3) Tolman's Cognitive Behaviourism
        Scientists must consider the purpose or goal of an organism to really understand behaviour (current objectives influencing behaviour)
        EX: two hungry rats race to the end of a maze, one is aware of the prize and the other is not, the one that is aware
        will behave differently. Cognitive map. Latent Learning
    4) Bandura's Social Learning Theory
        Cognitive-behavioural approach that emphasizes the role of observational learning and cognitive variables in explaining human behaviour.
        Basically reciprocal determinism or molar theory
        EX: Environmental influences can affect thought and feelings, or thoughts and feelings may influence actions.
    5) Skinner's Radical Behaviourism
        Emphasized the influence of the environment on obserbale behaviour rejects the use of internal events to explain behaviour.
        Only Environmental events can change thoughts and feelings and/or observable behaviour

Behaviour analysis is the basic science that is concerned with investigating principles of behaviour
Applied behaviour analysis is the technology that applies these principles to the practical modification of behaviour in the real world.

Terms and Definitions Related to metheods

Variable: a characteristic of a person, place, or thing, that can change
    independant variable: manipulating
    dependent variable: the measured of the independant

Functional Relationship:
    relationship between changes in an independent variable and dependent variable.
    results in if there is IS or IS NOT

Durand & Carr, 1992
They did a research of study impact of teacher attention in grade school with behavioural issues.
They tested to see if the teacher gives them more attention if it impacted or caused disruption.
They concluded a func relationship that high teacher attention results to no disruptive behaviour

Simulus: Any event that can potentially influence behaviour
Response: A particular instance of behaviour

A stimuli can either be appetitive or aversive
    Appetitive Stimuli: event that an organism will seek out
    Aversive Stimuli: event that an organism will avoid

Motivating Operations: anything that affects the appetivieness or aversiveness of an event
    Establishing Operations (EO): increase the appetivieness or aversiveness of an event
        "makes good things better or bad things worse"
    Abolishing Operations (AO): Decreases the appetitiveness or aversiveness of an event
        "if you ate a bunch of sushi you're likely less want sushi"

Contiguity: Means closeness or nearness
    Temporal: close within time
    Spaital: distance
Contingency: predicitve functional relationship between two events. Probable occurence.

Behavioural (operational):
    - A desctiopn of a property in concrete measurable terms
    - Should be precise, allow quantification, and allow agreement between observers

Recording Methods:
    1) Rate of response: frequency over time
    2) Intensity: force or magnitude of the behaviour
    3) Duration: length of time that the individual repeatedly performs a behaviour
    4) Speed: length in time i takes for an episode of behaviour to occur from start to finish
    5) Latency: the length of time required for a behaviour to begin
    6) Interval recording: whether a behaviour occurs within a series of continuous invervals
    7) Time-sampling Recording: whether a vehaviour occurs within a series of discountinuous intervals
    8) Topography: physical form of the behaviour (confidence)
    9) Number of Errors: number of mistakes made vs correct responses; usually shown as percentage

Interobserver Reliability/Agreement (IOA)
    Two or more observers calculate the extent to which the ovservers agreement
    A/(A+D), typically 80-90 % of agreement is required

Descriptive Research
    - Gathering information in a situation where it naturally occurs
    - no manipulation of variable or context
    + great for gaining a rich, detatiled understanding of behaviour
    - does not allow a researcher to draw cause and effect conclusions (no control)

Experimental Research:
    Group Designs: In each, one or more independent variables are manipulated
        Control Group Design -> individuals are assigned to a treatment while the other doesn't receive the actual treatment (controlled group)
        Factorial Design -> examines the effects of two or more indpendent variables across groups of subjects
        Comparative Design -> where different species make up one of the independent variables

Group Designs
    + Data is applicable to a large population
    + Cause-effect conclusions possible
    - requires a large number of subjects
    - Often impractical for indidual or treatment based
    - Little attention paid to individual performance
    - Data analyzed only at the end of the experiment

Single Subject Designs
    Simple-comparison (AB) design -> measure currently and compare to after
    Reversal design (ABA or ABAB) -> involves the repeated alternations between a baseline period and a treatment period
    Two-treatment Reversal Design (ABCAC) -> application of the reversal design to test the effectiveness of more than one treatment
        + allows entire experiment ot be conducted on a single subjects
        + may not need statistical tests to tell that the treatment is effective in changing behaviour
        - behaviour may not revert back to baseline
        - inappropiate for long-lasting effects to "unteach a skill"
        - may be ethically inappropriate
    Multiple-baseline designs -> Treatment is instituted at successive points for two or more:
        1) persons  2) settings or 3) behaviours
        + appropriate for treatments producing permanent change or unethical to withdraw once improvement is seen
        - Need more than 1 people, setting, behaviour
        - Treatment effect might generalize across settings or behaviour
    Changing-criterion design -> The effect of treatment is being systematically altered

    Non-human Animal Research for Behaviour?
        + can control the animal's genetic makeup
        + can control the animal's learning history
        + often able to strictly control the experimental environment for animals than for humans
        + cannot ethically be conducted on humans
        - Animals are not humans; may not apply to people
        - Morally wrong to conduct research on animals who do not get to volunteer

Elicited Behaviour
    - Automatic reaction, involuntary, occurs in response to stimuli

    Reflexes
        - simple, automatic response to a stimulus
        - startle, orienting, flexion

    Reflex Arcs: the neural structure containing sensory neurons, interneuorons and motor neuorons
    Fixed Action Patterns: a fixed sequence of responses slicited by a specific stimulus. Genetically programmed.
    Sign Stimulus (or releaser): the specific stimulus that elicits a fixed action pattern

Simple Mechanisms of Learning

    Habituation: Decrease in the strength of an elicited response following repeated
    presentations of the stimulus that natuarlly elicits that response.

    Long-term Habituation
    Stimuli are presented spaced overtime, slow to occur, slow to recover

    Short-term Habituation
    Stimuli are presented close together over time, quick to occur and recover.

    Sensitization
    Increase in the strength of an elicted response following repeated presentations
    of the stimulus that naturally elicits that reponse

    Dishabituation
    When habituated responses to a stimulus reappear following the presentation of another,
    seemingly unrelated, novel stimulus.

    Factors that influence habituation and sensitization
        Stimulus Intensity
        - Low intensity typically leads to Habituation
        - Moderate intensity leads to a initial period of sensitization, followed by Habituation
        - High intensity leads to sensitization

        Adatative Significance, unexpected sounds from stimuli
        Priror Learning, expected to have the stimuli
        Individual factors like temperament and personality
    
    Opponent-Process Theory of Emotion
        A-Process/primary process elicited directly by an event
        B-Process/opponent process elicited by the a process; designed to counteract

        Four Important Characteristics of a and b processes
        1) A-process correlates closely with the presence of the emotional event
        2) B-process is slow to increase and slow to Decrease
        3) Repeated presentations of the emotional event, the b-process increases in both strength and Duration
        4) A-process and b-process tend to be hedonically opposite of each other (emotionally opposite)

Classical Conditioning: A form of learning where a stimulus comes to elicit a repsonse because it has been
paired with another simulus.

Ivan Pavlov Discovery of Classical Conditioning
- Digestive research
    - Found anticipatroy secretions to environmental events accidentally
    - How siliva production influences digestion
    - A cannula was attached to dogs to measure how much saliva they produced
    - They would prepare food from a seperate room.
    - When they walk into to the room with food the bell would ring from the door
    and dogs would produce most salivas when food were placed in their mouth.
    - Eventaully the sound of the bell was paired with the taste of food
    - Therefore dogs would produce most saliva while the bell rings and when eating food

Types of Classical Conditioning Stimulus
- Neutral Stimulus (NS) - no natural or learned associations
- Unconditioned Stimulus (US) - biologically significant stimulus that already has a response associated with it
- Unconitioned Response (UR) - natural response to US
- Conditioned Stimulus (CS) - a previously neutral stimulus that comes to elicit a conditioned response
- Conditioned Reponse (CR) - elicited by a CS. Develops with many pairings of the CS with the US

Conditioning Diagrams
-> means elicits
: means followed by
-- means n/a

Example 1:
-before conditioning
    Food (US) -> Salivation (UR)
    Bell (NS) -> No salivation (--)
-during conditioning
    bell (NS) -> Salivation (UR)
-after conditioning
    bell (CS) -> Salivation (CR)

Example 2:
Bee Buzz (NS): Sting (US) -> Fear (UR)
Bee Buzz (CS) -> Fear (CR)

Two Unconditioned Stimulus:
1) Appetive conditioning: US is an event the animal will approach or seek
2) Aversive conditioning: US something the animal will try to avoid

Conditioned Suppression
    Measuring the level of fear an animal feels
    Suppression Ratio = (# of CS Responses)/(# of CS Responses + # of pre CS Responses)
    Lower Suppression Ratio means greater the Suppression
    0.5 no suppresion
    0 total suppression

Excitatory and Inhibitory Conditioning
    Excitatory conditioning: CS signals the presentation of a US, leads to a response
    Inhibitory conditioning: CS signals the absense/removal of a US therefore inhibits a repsonse

Temporal Factors in Conditioning
1) Short Delayed while cs is still being played, a response (US) is made
2) Trace after cs is done a response is then made
3) Long Delayed while cs is still being played, but longer, a response is made
4) Simultaneous CS and US happens at the sametime
5) Backward US happens before CS
For learning Delay would be best

Pseudoconditioning
An elicited response that appears to be a CR, but actually is the result of
sensitization rather than conditioning.

Jan 29, 2025 - Chapter 4
Acquisition
The process of developing and strengthening a conditioned response

Asymptote: Maximum amount of conditioning that can take place

Extinction is both a process and a procedure:
    Process: loss of ability for CS to elicit a CR; CS w/o US
    Procedure: repeated presentation of CS in the absence of the US

Spontaneous Recovery
    The reappearance of a conditioned response to a CS following a rest period after Extinction

Stimulus Generalization: Tendency for a CS to occur in the presence of a stimulus that is similar to the CS
Stimulus Discrimination: Occurs when we exhibit less pronounced CR to stimuli that differ from the orignal CS

Experimental Neurosis
An experimentally produced disorder in which animals exposed to unpredictable events devlop neurotic-like symptoms.
Similar to PTSD symptoms in humans

Extensions to Classical Conditioning
1) High-Order Conditioning
    A procedure in which a stimulus that is associated witha CS can also become a CS w/o being paird with a US.
    CR will always be bigger than UR
    EX:
    Metronome (NS1): Food (US) -> Salivation (UR)
    Metronome (CS1) -> Salivation (UR)

    Black square (NS2): Metronome (CS1) -> Salivation (CR)
    Black square (CS2) -> Salivation (CR)

2) Sensory Preconditioning
    When one stimulus is conditioned as a CS, another stimulus, with which it was previously associated
    becomes a CS w/o being paired with a US
    EX:
    Light (NS1): Tone (NS2) -> -- (100 times)

    Light (NS1): Shock (US) -> Flinch (UR)
    Light (CS1) -> Flinch (CR)

    Tone (CS2) -> Flinch

3) US Revaluation
    Post-conditioning presentation of a US at a different level of intensity can subsequently altered
    the strength of the response of a previously conditioned CS.
    US inflation: CR produced by the CS gets stronger because a stronger US was presented
    US deflation: CR produced by the CS gets weaker because a weaker US was presented
    EX:
    Buzzer (NS): 50mV Shock (US) -> Weak Flinch (UR)
    Buzzer (CS): Weak Flinkch (CR)

    200 mV Shock (US) -> Very Strong Flinch (UR)

    Buzzer (CS) -> Very Strong Flinch (CR)

Four Examples of Specificity in Classical Conditioning

    Compound Stimulus
    Consists of the simultaneous presentation of two or more individual stimuli

    Stimulus Saliency
    Perceived intensity of a stimulus

    [] in diagrams mean compound

    1) Overshadowing | shows that classical conditioning relies more than just temporal contiguity
    When the more salient member of a compound stimulus is more radily conditioned as a CS and thereby interferes
    with conditionoing of the less salient member.

    [Bright Light + Weak Tone] (NS): Shock (US) -> Fear (UR)

    [Bright Light (CS)] -> Fear (CR)
    Weak Tone (NS) -> -- (no reaction)

    2) Blocking | temporal contiguity is not the only important factor to determine if conditioning will take place
    When the presence of an establishd CS interferes with the conditioning of a new CS
    [Light (CS) + Tone (NS)]: Shock (US) -> Fear (UR)

    Light (CS) -> Fear (CR)
    Tone (NS) -> -- (no reaction)

    3) Occasion setting | classically conditioned associations can be situation specific
    A procedure in which a stimulus signals whether a CS is likely to be followed by a US and thereby controls whether
    the CS will elicit a CR

    Light On
        Tone (NS): Shock (US) -> Fear (UR)
    
    Light Off
        Tone (NS): nothing (--) -> no fear (--)
    
    Ligh On (OS or occasion setter)
        Tone (CS) -> Fear (CR)
    
    Light Off
        Tone (NS) -> no reaction (--)
    
    4) Latent Inhibition | ensures we do not develop conditioned responses to stimuli, we're paried with a US
    A familiar stimulus is more difficult to condition as a CS than is an unfamiliar (novel) stimulus

    Tone (NS): nothing (--) -> no reaction (--) {do this 1000x}

    Tone (NS): shock (US) -> Fear (UR) {do this 10x}
    Tone (NS) -> -- (no reaction)

    ---

    Tone (NS): nothing (--) -> no reaction (--) {do this 2x}

    Tone (NS): Shock (US) -> Fear (UR) {do this 10x}
    Tone (CS) -> Fear (CR)

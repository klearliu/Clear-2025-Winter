    Methoed of Research in Psychology

    Plato
    "Everything we know is inborn (nativist/nature perspective)"

    Aristotle
    "Knowledge is acquired through experience (empiricist/nurutre perspective)"

        Four Laws of Association:
        1) Law of Similarity: Connect things that are alike
            (ex. thinking of a cat when we see a lion).
        2) Law of Contrast: Thoughts of one extreme lead to thoughts of its opposite
            (ex. white leads to black).
        3) Law of Contiguity: We link things that happen close together in time or space
            (ex. lightning strike and hearing thunder soon after).
        4) Law of Frequency: The more often two things occur together, the stronger their association
            (ex. two people being together leads to them being close).

    Descartes
    "Human behaviour are not governed by free-will or reason"
    Mind-Body (Cartesian) Dualism
        Mind: Voluntary behaviour
        Body: Involuntary behaviour (injury causes a reaction w/o will)
    Only humans have a mind

    British Empiricists avocated that all knowledge is due to experience:
        John Locke:
            All ideas are acquired through experience, haphazardly
            Humans are born Tabula Rasa; a clean slate

    Structuralism: First scientific study of human experience
        Edward B. Titchener
            Studied the basic elements of conscious experience through a technique called introspection

    Funtionalism: Psychology should study the adaptive processes of the mind (asking why)
        William James
            Based on Darwin's theory of evolution
            Study of non-human animals encouraged to give insight into human behaviour

    Theory of Evolution
        Provides how changes occur in a species across generations through Natural Selection
        Difference between humans and non-human animals seen as one of degree, not kind.

    Behaviourism
        John Watson
            Natural science approach and emphasises the study of environmental influences on observable behaviour
            Psychology should only focus on observables

    S-R Theory: Learning involves attaching specific responses to specific stimuli in evnvironment
    Behaviour Analyst: basic principles of behaviour
    Applied behaviour analyst: applies basic principles to developing better metheods

    The Five Schools of Behaviourism
        1) Watson's Methodological Behaviourism
            Mechanistic (molecular) theory of Behaviourism
                An envioronmental event (stimulus) and specific behaviour (response)
            Psychologists should only study environmental influences on behaviours that can be directly observed
            EX: A rat is shocked, so it will try to avoid that area.
        2) Hull's Neobehaviourism
            Intervening variables influence behaviour (feelings influencing behaviour) also molecular
            Internal states like current status alters observable behaviour
            EX: A hungry rat performs differently in a maze than a non-hungry one.
            These things must be objectively identified, so you cannot say the rat is hungry, but can say the rat hasn't
            eaten in 5 days.
        3) Tolman's Cognitive Behaviourism
            Scientists must consider the purpose or goal of an organism to really understand behaviour (current objectives influencing behaviour)
            EX: two hungry rats race to the end of a maze, one is aware of the prize and the other is not, the one that is aware
            will behave differently. Cognitive map. Latent Learning
        4) Bandura's Social Learning Theory
            Cognitive-behavioural approach that emphasizes the role of observational learning and cognitive variables in explaining human behaviour.
            Basically reciprocal determinism or molar theory
            EX: Environmental influences can affect thought and feelings, or thoughts and feelings may influence actions.
        5) Skinner's Radical Behaviourism
            Emphasized the influence of the environment on obserbale behaviour rejects the use of internal events to explain behaviour.
            Only Environmental events can change thoughts and feelings and/or observable behaviour

    Behaviour analysis is the basic science that is concerned with investigating principles of behaviour
    Applied behaviour analysis is the technology that applies these principles to the practical modification of behaviour in the real world.

    Terms and Definitions Related to metheods

    Variable: a characteristic of a person, place, or thing, that can change
        independant variable: manipulating
        dependent variable: the measured of the independant

    Functional Relationship:
        relationship between changes in an independent variable and dependent variable.
        results in if there is IS or IS NOT

    Durand & Carr, 1992
    They did a research of study impact of teacher attention in grade school with behavioural issues.
    They tested to see if the teacher gives them more attention if it impacted or caused disruption.
    They concluded a func relationship that high teacher attention results to no disruptive behaviour

    Simulus: Any event that can potentially influence behaviour
    Response: A particular instance of behaviour

    A stimuli can either be appetitive or aversive
        Appetitive Stimuli: event that an organism will seek out
        Aversive Stimuli: event that an organism will avoid

    Motivating Operations: anything that affects the appetivieness or aversiveness of an event
        Establishing Operations (EO): increase the appetivieness or aversiveness of an event
            "makes good things better or bad things worse"
        Abolishing Operations (AO): Decreases the appetitiveness or aversiveness of an event
            "if you ate a bunch of sushi you're likely less want sushi"

    Contiguity: Means closeness or nearness
        Temporal: close within time
        Spaital: distance
    Contingency: predicitve functional relationship between two events. Probable occurence.

    Behavioural (operational):
        - A desctiopn of a property in concrete measurable terms
        - Should be precise, allow quantification, and allow agreement between observers

    Recording Methods:
        1) Rate of response: frequency over time
        2) Intensity: force or magnitude of the behaviour
        3) Duration: length of time that the individual repeatedly performs a behaviour
        4) Speed: length in time i takes for an episode of behaviour to occur from start to finish
        5) Latency: the length of time required for a behaviour to begin
        6) Interval recording: whether a behaviour occurs within a series of continuous invervals
        7) Time-sampling Recording: whether a vehaviour occurs within a series of discountinuous intervals
        8) Topography: physical form of the behaviour (confidence)
        9) Number of Errors: number of mistakes made vs correct responses; usually shown as percentage

    Interobserver Reliability/Agreement (IOA)
        Two or more observers calculate the extent to which the ovservers agreement
        A/(A+D), typically 80-90 % of agreement is required

    Descriptive Research
        - Gathering information in a situation where it naturally occurs
        - no manipulation of variable or context
        + great for gaining a rich, detatiled understanding of behaviour
        - does not allow a researcher to draw cause and effect conclusions (no control)

    Experimental Research:
        Group Designs: In each, one or more independent variables are manipulated
            Control Group Design -> individuals are assigned to a treatment while the other doesn't receive the actual treatment (controlled group)
            Factorial Design -> examines the effects of two or more indpendent variables across groups of subjects
            Comparative Design -> where different species make up one of the independent variables

    Group Designs
        + Data is applicable to a large population
        + Cause-effect conclusions possible
        - requires a large number of subjects
        - Often impractical for indidual or treatment based
        - Little attention paid to individual performance
        - Data analyzed only at the end of the experiment

    Single Subject Designs
        Simple-comparison (AB) design -> measure currently and compare to after
        Reversal design (ABA or ABAB) -> involves the repeated alternations between a baseline period and a treatment period
        Two-treatment Reversal Design (ABCAC) -> application of the reversal design to test the effectiveness of more than one treatment
            + allows entire experiment ot be conducted on a single subjects
            + may not need statistical tests to tell that the treatment is effective in changing behaviour
            - behaviour may not revert back to baseline
            - inappropiate for long-lasting effects to "unteach a skill"
            - may be ethically inappropriate
        Multiple-baseline designs -> Treatment is instituted at successive points for two or more:
            1) persons  2) settings or 3) behaviours
            + appropriate for treatments producing permanent change or unethical to withdraw once improvement is seen
            - Need more than 1 people, setting, behaviour
            - Treatment effect might generalize across settings or behaviour
        Changing-criterion design -> The effect of treatment is being systematically altered

        Non-human Animal Research for Behaviour?
            + can control the animal's genetic makeup
            + can control the animal's learning history
            + often able to strictly control the experimental environment for animals than for humans
            + cannot ethically be conducted on humans
            - Animals are not humans; may not apply to people
            - Morally wrong to conduct research on animals who do not get to volunteer

    Elicited Behaviour
        - Automatic reaction, involuntary, occurs in response to stimuli

        Reflexes
            - simple, automatic response to a stimulus
            - startle, orienting, flexion

        Reflex Arcs: the neural structure containing sensory neurons, interneuorons and motor neuorons
        Fixed Action Patterns: a fixed sequence of responses slicited by a specific stimulus. Genetically programmed.
        Sign Stimulus (or releaser): the specific stimulus that elicits a fixed action pattern

    Simple Mechanisms of Learning

        Habituation: Decrease in the strength of an elicited response following repeated
        presentations of the stimulus that natuarlly elicits that response.

        Long-term Habituation
        Stimuli are presented spaced overtime, slow to occur, slow to recover

        Short-term Habituation
        Stimuli are presented close together over time, quick to occur and recover.

        Sensitization
        Increase in the strength of an elicted response following repeated presentations
        of the stimulus that naturally elicits that reponse

        Dishabituation
        When habituated responses to a stimulus reappear following the presentation of another,
        seemingly unrelated, novel stimulus.

        Factors that influence habituation and sensitization
            Stimulus Intensity
            - Low intensity typically leads to Habituation
            - Moderate intensity leads to a initial period of sensitization, followed by Habituation
            - High intensity leads to sensitization

            Adatative Significance, unexpected sounds from stimuli
            Priror Learning, expected to have the stimuli
            Individual factors like temperament and personality
        
        Opponent-Process Theory of Emotion
            A-Process/primary process elicited directly by an event
            B-Process/opponent process elicited by the a process; designed to counteract

            Four Important Characteristics of a and b processes
            1) A-process correlates closely with the presence of the emotional event
            2) B-process is slow to increase and slow to Decrease
            3) Repeated presentations of the emotional event, the b-process increases in both strength and Duration
            4) A-process and b-process tend to be hedonically opposite of each other (emotionally opposite)

    Classical Conditioning: A form of learning where a stimulus comes to elicit a repsonse because it has been
    paired with another simulus.

    Ivan Pavlov Discovery of Classical Conditioning
    - Digestive research
        - Found anticipatroy secretions to environmental events accidentally
        - How siliva production influences digestion
        - A cannula was attached to dogs to measure how much saliva they produced
        - They would prepare food from a seperate room.
        - When they walk into to the room with food the bell would ring from the door
        and dogs would produce most salivas when food were placed in their mouth.
        - Eventaully the sound of the bell was paired with the taste of food
        - Therefore dogs would produce most saliva while the bell rings and when eating food

    Types of Classical Conditioning Stimulus
    - Neutral Stimulus (NS) - no natural or learned associations
    - Unconditioned Stimulus (US) - biologically significant stimulus that already has a response associated with it
    - Unconitioned Response (UR) - natural response to US
    - Conditioned Stimulus (CS) - a previously neutral stimulus that comes to elicit a conditioned response
    - Conditioned Reponse (CR) - elicited by a CS. Develops with many pairings of the CS with the US

    Conditioning Diagrams
    -> means elicits
    : means followed by
    -- means n/a

    Example 1:
    -before conditioning
        Food (US) -> Salivation (UR)
        Bell (NS) -> No salivation (--)
    -during conditioning
        bell (NS) -> Salivation (UR)
    -after conditioning
        bell (CS) -> Salivation (CR)

    Example 2:
    Bee Buzz (NS): Sting (US) -> Fear (UR)
    Bee Buzz (CS) -> Fear (CR)

    Two Unconditioned Stimulus:
    1) Appetive conditioning: US is an event the animal will approach or seek
    2) Aversive conditioning: US something the animal will try to avoid

    Conditioned Suppression
        Measuring the level of fear an animal feels
        Suppression Ratio = (# of CS Responses)/(# of CS Responses + # of pre CS Responses)
        Lower Suppression Ratio means greater the Suppression
        0.5 no suppresion
        0 total suppression

    Excitatory and Inhibitory Conditioning
        Excitatory conditioning: CS signals the presentation of a US, leads to a response
        Inhibitory conditioning: CS signals the absense/removal of a US therefore inhibits a repsonse

    Temporal Factors in Conditioning
    1) Short Delayed while cs is still being played, a response (US) is made
    2) Trace after cs is done a response is then made
    3) Long Delayed while cs is still being played, but longer, a response is made
    4) Simultaneous CS and US happens at the sametime
    5) Backward US happens before CS
    For learning Delay would be best

    Pseudoconditioning
    An elicited response that appears to be a CR, but actually is the result of
    sensitization rather than conditioning.

    Jan 29, 2025 - Chapter 4
    Acquisition
    The process of developing and strengthening a conditioned response

    Asymptote: Maximum amount of conditioning that can take place

    Extinction is both a process and a procedure:
        Process: loss of ability for CS to elicit a CR; CS w/o US
        Procedure: repeated presentation of CS in the absence of the US

    Spontaneous Recovery
        The reappearance of a conditioned response to a CS following a rest period after Extinction

    Stimulus Generalization: Tendency for a CS to occur in the presence of a stimulus that is similar to the CS
    Stimulus Discrimination: Occurs when we exhibit less pronounced CR to stimuli that differ from the orignal CS

    Experimental Neurosis
    An experimentally produced disorder in which animals exposed to unpredictable events devlop neurotic-like symptoms.
    Similar to PTSD symptoms in humans

    Extensions to Classical Conditioning
    1) High-Order Conditioning
        A procedure in which a stimulus that is associated witha CS can also become a CS w/o being paird with a US.
        CR will always be bigger than UR
        EX:
        Metronome (NS1): Food (US) -> Salivation (UR)
        Metronome (CS1) -> Salivation (UR)

        Black square (NS2): Metronome (CS1) -> Salivation (CR)
        Black square (CS2) -> Salivation (CR)

    2) Sensory Preconditioning
        When one stimulus is conditioned as a CS, another stimulus, with which it was previously associated
        becomes a CS w/o being paired with a US
        EX:
        Light (NS1): Tone (NS2) -> -- (100 times)

        Light (NS1): Shock (US) -> Flinch (UR)
        Light (CS1) -> Flinch (CR)

        Tone (CS2) -> Flinch

    3) US Revaluation
        Post-conditioning presentation of a US at a different level of intensity can subsequently altered
        the strength of the response of a previously conditioned CS.
        US inflation: CR produced by the CS gets stronger because a stronger US was presented
        US deflation: CR produced by the CS gets weaker because a weaker US was presented
        EX:
        Buzzer (NS): 50mV Shock (US) -> Weak Flinch (UR)
        Buzzer (CS): Weak Flinkch (CR)

        200 mV Shock (US) -> Very Strong Flinch (UR)

        Buzzer (CS) -> Very Strong Flinch (CR)

    Four Examples of Specificity in Classical Conditioning

        Compound Stimulus
        Consists of the simultaneous presentation of two or more individual stimuli

        Stimulus Saliency
        Perceived intensity of a stimulus

        [] in diagrams mean compound

        1) Overshadowing | shows that classical conditioning relies more than just temporal contiguity
        When the more salient member of a compound stimulus is more radily conditioned as a CS and thereby interferes
        with conditionoing of the less salient member.

        [Bright Light + Weak Tone] (NS): Shock (US) -> Fear (UR)

        [Bright Light (CS)] -> Fear (CR)
        Weak Tone (NS) -> -- (no reaction)

        2) Blocking | temporal contiguity is not the only important factor to determine if conditioning will take place
        When the presence of an establishd CS interferes with the conditioning of a new CS
        [Light (CS) + Tone (NS)]: Shock (US) -> Fear (UR)

        Light (CS) -> Fear (CR)
        Tone (NS) -> -- (no reaction)

        3) Occasion setting | classically conditioned associations can be situation specific
        A procedure in which a stimulus signals whether a CS is likely to be followed by a US and thereby controls whether
        the CS will elicit a CR

        Light On
            Tone (NS): Shock (US) -> Fear (UR)
        
        Light Off
            Tone (NS): nothing (--) -> no fear (--)
        
        Ligh On (OS or occasion setter)
            Tone (CS) -> Fear (CR)
        
        Light Off
            Tone (NS) -> no reaction (--)
        
        4) Latent Inhibition | ensures we do not develop conditioned responses to stimuli, we're paried with a US
        A familiar stimulus is more difficult to condition as a CS than is an unfamiliar (novel) stimulus

        Tone (NS): nothing (--) -> no reaction (--) {do this 1000x}

        Tone (NS): shock (US) -> Fear (UR) {do this 10x}
        Tone (NS) -> -- (no reaction)

        ---

        Tone (NS): nothing (--) -> no reaction (--) {do this 2x}

        Tone (NS): Shock (US) -> Fear (UR) {do this 10x}
        Tone (CS) -> Fear (CR)

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exam 2
    Chapter 5
    Stimulus Substitution Theory
        CS acts as a substitution for US
        if true, CR should always be same as UR

    Preparatory Response Theory
        Purpose of conditioning is to prepare the organism for the presentation of the US
        Allows for cases where CR and UR are different

    Compensatory Response Theory
        CR produces opposite raction of UR (to compensate)
        Connected to opponent process theory (A/B processes)
        Used to explain drug tolerance, cravings, and overdoses

        In summary:
        B process with no A process
        B process weakens the effect of the A process
        So user does something to increase A process
        Very strong A process with no B process

    Rescorla Wagner Model
        Mathematical model of conditioning
        US can only support so much conditioning and must be distibuted among the various CS that are presentation
        Stronger stimuli (CS and US) support more contioning
        Allows prediction of how quickly learning should occur based on knowledge of certain factors
        It can explain overshadowing and blocking very well
        Associative Value: amount of conditioning
        CS will acquire the associative value and then CS will have as much and as strong as UR

        Overshadowing:
        [bright light (v=0) + quiet tone (v=0)]: Food (Max v = 10) -> Salivation
        Bright light (v=8) -> lots of salivation
        Quiet tone (v=2) -> almost no salivation

        Blocking:
        [bright light (v=0) + quiet tone (v=0)]: Food (Max v = 10) -> Salivation
        Bright light (v=10) -> lots of salivation
        Quiet tone (v=0) -> no salivation

        Rescorla Wagner model does not explain all conditioning phenomena.

    Phobias: An excessive or extreme fear response to a stimulus that are not at all dangerous or
    minimally dangerous, mostly.

    ex: developing a Phobias
    Back seat of car (NS): Pain from Accident (US) -> Fear (UR)
    Back seat of car (CS) -> Fear (CR)

    Factors that Impact Phobia Development
        - Observational learning: w/o direct confrontations just by watching others
        Snake on TV (NS): Look of fear from Mom's face (US) -> Fear (UR)
        Snake on TV (CS) -> Fear (CR)
        - temperament: INDIVIDUAL's level of emotional reactivity, genetically determined
        - preparedness: learn certain types of behaviours/associations more easily than others, easier to develop fear of spiders than flowers
        - incubation: strengthening of a conditioned fear response
        - US re-evaluation: exposure to a US of a different intensity
        - selective sensitization: exposure to an unrelated stressful event, external factors added on.

    Treating Phobias
    - Systematic Desensitization: pairing relaxation with succession of feared stimulus
        -Imaginal Desensitization: imagining the phobic stimulus
        -In Vivo Desensitization: clincian presents the phobic stimulus

        1) Create a hierarchy of fear producing situations
        2) Teach relaxation skills
        - muscle tension reduction
        - relaxed breathing
        - attention focusing
        3) Progress through the hierarchy

        - Counterconditioning
        A CS that elicits one type of response is associated with an event that elicits an incompatible response.

    Operant Conditioning: is learning where the future frequency or probability of behaviour is controlled by its consequences.

    Law of Effect (Edwin Thorndike)
    Behaviours leading to a satisfying state of affairs are strengthend/stamped in, while unsatisfying ones are weakened/stamped out
        - discovered by puzzel box experiments with cats

    Skinner Box (Operant conditioning chamber)
    Automotaed box to measure animal behaviour and provide outcomes based on that behaviour. Animal "free to respond" at any rate and time

    Operant Behaviour (R): a class of emitted responses that result in certain consequences which affects
    the future frequency of these responses. -> means emitted or voluntarly
        EX:
        Curse at parents (R) -> Grounded -- results in less likely to curse at parents in the future
        Child yells for candy (R) -> Parents give child candy -- results in child for yelling

    Operant Consequences
        I) Reinforcers (SR): increases the frequency of behaviour
        II) Punishers (SP): decreases

    Discriminative stimulus (SD): the presence of which responses are reinforced and in the absence of which they are not reinforced.
        EX
        Parents Home (SD): Make a mess (R) -> Grounded (SP)

        Descriminative stimulus for extinction: signals absence of reinforcement or punishment (S-delta)
        EX
        Parents home (SD): Throw party (R) -> Grounded (SP)
        Parents away (S-Delta) -> --

    Four Types of Outcome Contingencies
        Reinforcement: encourage the response
            - Positive (SR+) presentation of stimulus after response, behaviour is strengthened
                Child yells in store (R) -> Give them what they want (SR+) | result: child more likely to yell in store
            - Negative (SR-) presentation of aversive or unwanted stimulus is removed, beavhiour is strengthened
                Take medication for headache (R) -> Headache goes away (SR-) | result: take medication when headache occurs
            
            Escape behaviour: results in termination, behaviour strengthen
            Avoidance behaviour results in prevention, behaviour strengthen

        Punishment: decrease the likelyhood of response
            - Positive (SP+) presentation of stimulus after response, behaviour is weakened
                Speeding (R) -> Cop gives ticket (SP+) | result: less likely to speed
            - Negative (SP-) presentation of stimulus is removed, behaviour is weaked
                Child swears at dinner table (R) -> Sent to room (SP-) | result: less likely to swear at dinner table
            
            Time-out: loss of access to most/all positive reinforcers for a brief period of time
            Reponse cost: removal of a specific reinforcer

        Immediate Vs Delayed Reinforcement
            - The more dealyed a reinforcer after behaviour, the weaker the effect. Immediate is better for learning
        
        Primary and Secondary Reinforcers
            Primary (unconditioned): Biologically determined or survival value for the individual
            Secondary (conditioned): Previously neutral stimulus that has been repeatedly paired with an established reinforcer
                Generalized secondary reinforcers: reinforcer that are paired with a wide variety of other primay reinforcers. Ex. money

        Intrinsic Reinforcement: the mere act of performing the behaviour
        Extrinsic Reinforcement: some consequence that is external to the behaviour

        Natural Reinforcers: provided for certain behaviours | ex. putting something up for sale and getting money for it
        Contrived Reinforcers: arranged to modify a behabiour; not a typical consequence | ex. studying for 1hr leads to 12hrs of whatever you want

        Shaping: gradual creation or steps of a new behaviour through reinforcement of successively closer approximations. "creating new baseline"

    Schedule of reinforcement
    the response requirement thtat must be met to obtain reinforcement

        1) Continuous Reinforcement Schedule (CRF)
            Reinforce a behaviour every time it occurs
            Fast learning, labour intensive, extinction can occur quickly
        2) Partial reinforcement schedules (PRF)
            Only some responses are reinforced
            slower learning, less labour, more resistant to extinction

            Ratio Schedules: require a certain number of responses to be performed before a reinforcer is delivered
                I) Fixed ration (FR): number of responses is known to the orgainism, some pauses
                II) Variable Ratio (VR): number of responses is not predictable but averagely similar, no pauses here, high steady

                Ratio Strain: disruption in responding due to an overly demanding response requirement
                Post reinforcement pauses: breaks after a reinforcer

            Interval Schedules: reinforce first behaviour after period of time has elapsed
                III) Fixed Interval (FI): first reponse after a specific period of time leads to the delivery of reinforcer,
                    scalloped shaped graph
                IV) Variable Interval (VI): first response after a varying, unpredictable period of time, steady Rate,
                    nearly no pausing, moderate rate
            
        Simple schedule: to describe schedules of reinforcemnt that only have one requirement to be satisfied
        for reinforcement to be delivered
            - Duration schedules: reinforcement is contingent on performing a behaviour continuously throughout a period of time
                Fixed duration schedule (FD): behaviour must be performed continuously for a fixed, predicatbale period of time
                Variable duration schedule (VD): behaviour must be performed continuously for a varying, unpredictable period of time

            - Response rate schedules: directly contingent upon the organism's rate of response
                Differential Reinforcements of High Rates (DRH): "at lease" or minimum specified
                ... of Low Rates (DRL): "no more than" or maximum specified
                ... of paced responding (DRP): creates lower and upper bounds of an action 
            
            - Noncontingent Schedules: reinforcer is delivered independently of any response. Response is not required for the reinforcer to be obtained
                Fixed Time (FT) schedule: fixed, predictable period of time, regardless of the organism's behaviour
                Variable Time (VT) schedule: varying, unpredictable period of time, regardless of organism's behaviour
        
        Complex Schedules of Reinforcement: a combination of two or more simple schedules
            - Conjuctive schedules: two or more simple schedules must be met before a reinforcer is delivered
            - Adjusting schedules: response requirement changes as a function of the organism's performance while responding for the previous reinforcer
            - Chained schedules: consits fo a sequence of two or more simple schedules followed in a terminal reinforcer.
                - weaker in earlier links aka the goal gradient effect (GGE)

        Theories of Reinforcement
        1) Drive Reduction Theory
            An event is reinforcing to the extent that it is associated with a reduction of some physiological drive.
            Similar to Hell (or Neobehaviourism)

        2) The Premack Principles
            Based on the notion that reinforcers can often be viewed as behaviours rather than observable stimuli
            High-probability behaviour (HPB): likely to do
            Low-probability behaviour (LPB): less likely to do
            "the high probability" becomes the reinforcer of the "low probability behaviour"

        3) Response Deprivation Hypothesis
            behaviour can serve as a reinforcer when:
                1. access to the behaviour is restricted
                2. its frequency thereby falls below its preferred level of occurrence
            this makes the action of wanted the remaining access to behaviour as a reinforce.

        4) Behavioural Bliss Point Approach
            an organism with free access to alternative activities will distribute its behaviour in such a way
            as maximize overall reinforcement. They will distribute its activities in such ways to draw as near
            to the bliss point as possible.

    Chapter 8

    Stimulus Control: presence of an SD reliably affects the probability of the behaviour being expressed. uses the term "evokes"

    Stimulus Generalization in Operant Conditioning
    The likelyhood of a response being emitted that had a consequence associated with it
        Generalization gradient: a method of depicting the strength of responding in the presence of 

    Stimulus descrimination
    tendency for an operant response to be emitted more in the presence of one stimulus than another

    SD exerts stimulus control over the behaviour
    SD evokes the behaviour

    Peak Shift Effect
    The peak of a generalization gradient following discrimination training will shift fromt he SD to a stimulus that's further
    removed from the S-Delta

    Excitation develops around SD
    Inhibition develops around S-Delta

    Mutiple schedules used to study stimulus control
    Consist of two or more independent schedules presented in sequence each resulting in reinforcement and each havin a distinctive SD

    Behavioural Contrast: when the change in the rate of reinforcement on one component produces an opposite change in the rate of response
    Negative contrast effect: An increase in the rate of reinforcement on one component produces a decrease in the rate of reponse (2nd goes down)
    Postive contrast effect: A decrease in the rate of reinforcement on one component produces a increase in the rate of response (2nd goes up)

    Anticipatory Contrast
    Rate of response varies inversely with an upcoming change in the rate of reinforcement

    Fading and Errorless descrimination training
        - A gradual training procedure that minimizes the number of errors where the faded thing that turns bold will be ignored
        - training animals go through this regime

Escape and Avoidance
Escape Behaviour: performance of a behaviour that terminates an aversive stimulus
Avoidance Behaviour: prevents the aversive stimulus from occuring

Shuttle Avoidance Procedure
    Escape Behaviour:
        Shock (SD): Cross Barrier (R) -> Removal of Shock (SR)
    Avoidance Behaviour:
        Light (SD): Cross Barrier (R) -> Avoidance of Shock (SR)

Mower's Two-Process Theory of Avoidance
    two processes are involved in learning an avoidance response
    
    Problems with this theory:
    1) avoidance responses extremely persistent
    Anxiety Conservation Hypothesis: avoidance responses happen so quickly that
    there's insufficient exposure to the CS for the conditioned fear to fully extinguish
    
    2) after a great number of trials, animals continue to avoid, but show no evidence of fear

One-Process Theory
Reduction of shocks is the primary cause of avoidance behaviour

Avoidance and Phobias
    Mineka:
        - nature of what's being avoided is different
        - difference in the time to learn and strength of avoidance response between
        experimental and phobic conditioning.
    Stampfl:
        1) reliable establishment of a fear response with only a single brief pairing of the CS and US
        2) avoidance of the CS and the US
        3) occurrence of successful avoidance on 100% of trials
        
        a contraption called an automated alleyway

Avoidance and OCD
    OCD: Obsessive compulsive disorder. A disorder characterized by persistent thoughts, impulses or images, and
    repetitive stereotyped actions.

    - Anxiety is the classically conditioned response elicited by exposure to, and thinking about a stimulus
    - Compulsive action is the operant response that is negatively reinforced by reduction in anxiety

Recap: Positive Punishment and Negative Punishment
    Positive: Behaviour decreases due to the presentation of consequences
    Negative: Behaviour decreases due to removal of consequence

Types of Negative Punishment
    Time-out: Loss of access to "usually all positive reinforcers" for a brief period of time following the occurrence of a problem behaviour
    Response cost: removal of a "specific reinforcer" following the occurrence of a problem behaviour

    Recall negative punishment means removal of something 
    Extinction perfoming the behaviour that no longer leads to the provided

    Instrinsic punishment: punishment that is an inherent aspect of the behaviour being punished
        ex. feeling sore after a workout
    Extrinsic punishment: punishment that is not an inherent aspect of the behaviour being punished
        ex. losing a laptop everytime someone does drugs (kind of like an added bit that is unrelated)
    
Primay Punisher: an event that is innately punishing
Secondary Punisher: an event that has become punishing because it has been associated with some other punisher

Prombolems with Punishment
1) Punishing a maladaptive behaviour does not directly strengthen the occurrence of appropriate or adaptive behaviour
2) May result in generalized suppression of behaviour
3) Person giving punishment may become SD for punishment
4) May teach to avoid person who delivered punishment
5) Elicit a strong emotional response
6) Elicit an aggressive reaction
7) Could teach another that punishment is a good way to control behaviour
8) Punishment strongly reinforced and thus becomes overused

Benefits of using Punishment
1) Can sometimes lead to increase in social behaviour
2) Sometimes results in an improvement of mood
3) Increase attention to the environment

Effective use of Punishment
1) Should be immediate rather than delayed
2) Should consistently follow each occurrence of the unwanted behaviour
3) Should be intense enough to suppress the target behaviour
4) Negative punishment is preferable to positive punishment
5) More effective when accompanied by an explanation
6) Punishment of inappropriate behviour should be combined with positive reinforcement for appropriate behaviour

Theories of Punishment
    Conditioned suppression theory
    Assumes that punishment does not weaken a behaviour but produces an emotional response that interferes with the occurrence of behaviour

    Avoidance Theory
    Holds that punishment actually involves a type of avoidance conditioning in which the avoidance response consists of any
    behaviour other than the behaviour being punished (punished gets weaker, but the other strengthens)

    Premack Approach
    Assumes a low-probability behaviour can be used to punish a high-probability behaviour

Learned Helplessness
    A decrement in learning ability that results from repeated exposure to uncontrollable aversive events
    - Learned helplessness can also force organism to escape aversive stimulus and graded series of tasks (simple to complex)

Experimental Neurosis
An experimentally produced disorder in which animals exposed to unpredictable events develop neurotic-like symptoms

Environmental Earth Science == the study of interconnected systems that make up the habitable portion of the Earth

Types of spheres on Earth (sub systems)
    - Atmosphere: gasses surrounding earth
    - Hydrosphere: water of the earth
        - Cryosphere: water at its frozen state (below 0 degrees celsius)
    - Lithosphere: earth's crust and upper mantle (rocks)
    - Biosphere: all living things of earth

Systems on Earth | Inputs -> Actions -> Outputs
inputs: Energy and matter
actions: Convert energy and matter to other forms, store energy and matter
output: Energy and matter

Conservation Laws of Mass and Energy
Mass and Energy is neither destroyed nor created (for earth systems)
Energy is the capacity to change the motion
    [1] Storage Change = Input - Output

Three types of systems
Open system: Energy and matter can flow in and out (ex. a car)
    inputs: energy matter (fuel)
    actions: energy and material conversions, energy and material Storage (conversions)
    outputs: energy matter (exhaust)

Closed system: Matter is contained, energy can flow in and out (ex. photosynthesis)
    inputs: CO2, water, sunlight
    actions: Converted to simple sugars
    outputs: o2 and water

Isolated system: No matter or energy transference

System Feedbacks:
    - Feedback: output from a systm that also serves as an input to the same system
        - Negative: discourages change in the system (stability)
        - Positive: encourages change in the system (runaway)

System Equilibrium
    Steady-state: amounts of energy and matter fluctuate around a stable average
    Dynamic: amounts of energy and matter follow a changing trend over time and system adjusts

Earth as a Closed System: matter stays put, energy enters and leaves

Cosmophere
    Our solar system is located in the milky way galaxy
    Galaxy: stars and steller remnants

The Sun's Energy
    Produces energy by fusion
    Energy outputs:
        Solar Wind: H+ and e-
        Radiant energy: light

Light as a Wave
    Proposed by James Clerk Maxwell
    EM radiation travels through space as a wave at the speed of light

    EM wave
    Electric and magnetic will always be perpendicular to each other in a wave

Electromagnetic Spectrum
    Radio, microwave, thermal infrared, middle infrared, shortwave infrared, near infrared, visible
    ultra violet, xrays, gamma rays

Solar Spectrum
    Spectrum: measurement of the EM radiation radiating from or reflecting off an object at each wavelength

Blackbody radiation
    Blackbody: theoretical object that absorbs all incoming energy perfectly and re-radiates that energy perfectly

    λ = k/T; k=2898µmK

Environmental Earth Science == the study of interconnected systems that make up the habitable portion of the Earth

Types of spheres on Earth (sub systems)
    - Atmosphere: gasses surrounding earth
    - Hydrosphere: water of the earth
        - Cryosphere: water at its frozen state (below 0 degrees celsius)
    - Lithosphere: earth's crust and upper mantle (rocks)
    - Biosphere: all living things of earth

Systems on Earth | Inputs -> Actions -> Outputs
inputs: Energy and matter
actions: Convert energy and matter to other forms, store energy and matter
output: Energy and matter

Conservation Laws of Mass and Energy
Mass and Energy is neither destroyed nor created (for earth systems)
Energy is the capacity to change the motion
    [1] Storage Change = Input - Output

Three types of systems
Open system: Energy and matter can flow in and out (ex. a car)
    inputs: energy matter (fuel)
    actions: energy and material conversions, energy and material Storage (conversions)
    outputs: energy matter (exhaust)

Closed system: Matter is contained, energy can flow in and out (ex. photosynthesis)
    inputs: CO2, water, sunlight
    actions: Converted to simple sugars
    outputs: o2 and water

Isolated system: No matter or energy transference

System Feedbacks:
    - Feedback: output from a systm that also serves as an input to the same system
        - Negative: discourages change in the system (stability)
        - Positive: encourages change in the system (runaway)

System Equilibrium
    Steady-state: amounts of energy and matter fluctuate around a stable average
    Dynamic: amounts of energy and matter follow a changing trend over time and system adjusts

Earth as a Closed System: matter stays put, energy enters and leaves

Cosmophere
    Our solar system is located in the milky way galaxy
    Galaxy: stars and steller remnants

The Sun's Energy
    Produces energy by fusion
    Energy outputs:
        Solar Wind: H+ and e-
        Radiant energy: light

Light as a Wave
    Proposed by James Clerk Maxwell
    EM radiation travels through space as a wave at the speed of light

    EM wave
    Electric and magnetic will always be perpendicular to each other in a wave

Electromagnetic Spectrum
    Radio, microwave, thermal infrared, middle infrared, shortwave infrared, near infrared, visible
    ultra violet, xrays, gamma rays

Solar Spectrum
    Spectrum: measurement of the EM radiation radiating from or reflecting off an object at each wavelength

Blackbody radiation
    Blackbody: theoretical object that absorbs all incoming energy perfectly and re-radiates that energy perfectly

    λ = k/T; k=2898µmK

Earth abosrbs solar energy at high frequencies (visible) and radiates energy by emission at low frequencies infrared.

    Solar Radiation:
        UV (xrays, gamma rays)
        Visible light
        infrared
    Wein's Laws
        High energy == shortwave radiation == high temperature
        Low energy == longwave radiation == low temperature

Specturm = measurement of the EM radiation radiating from or reflecting off an object at each wavelength

Longitude = angluar distance east or west of a point on Earth's surface
    prime meridian designated as 0 degrees

Latitude = angular distance north or south of the equator

Insolation = incoming solar radiation
    Intensity of sunlight that hits a point on Earth
    Higher insolation during summer

Distribution of Insolation
    Thermopause is the outer boundary of Earth's energy system
    Tropics receive more concentrated insolation
    subsolar point is the location where insolation is perpendicular to the surface

Higher latitudes have lower insolation:
    incoming sunlight must pass through more Atmosphere
    one unit of sunlight gets spread across more average

Net Radiation = incoming shortwave radiation - outgoing longwave radiation

Why we have Seasons
    Geometry of Earth's orbit around the sun
        - Eccentricity: Shape of Earth's orbit
        - Obliquity: Tilt of Earth's rotational axis
        - Precession: Orentation of Earth's rotational axis (the wobble of Earth's axis)
    
    North America is farthest away from the sun July 4 (aphelion) and closest January 3 (perihelion)

Spring equinox (mar 21 or 22)
    Overhead sun is at 90deg the equator
Summer solstace (jun 21 or 22)
    Overhead sun is at 90deg on the tropic of cancer
    24hrs of daylight in the artic circle
Autumn equinox (sep 22 or 23)
    Overhead sun is at 90deg the equator
    At all days they are all 12 hemispheres
Winter solstace (dec 21 or 22)
    Overhead sun is at 90deg on the tropic of capricorn
    24 hrs of daylight in the antartic

For northern hemispheres our winter solstace is dec 21 and summer is june 21

Effects on insolation
    Day Length
        - Longer the day == the more daily insolation
    Solar Altitude (noon sun angle)
        Low angle
            - Insolation is more diffuse
            - must pass through more atmosphere; causes scattering and reflection
        High angle
            - Insolation more concentrated

Light as a shortwave:
    - Transmitted
    - Reflected: earth's surface, clouds, atmospheric gases and dust
    - Refracted: atmosphere gases
    - Scattered: atmosphere gases; caused by reflecting and refracting at the sametime
        - rough surfaces (lambertian relectors)
        - aerosols (gas molecules, dust, smoke, water molecules)
    - Absorbed: earth's surface, atmospheric gases and dust, stratopheric ozone, clouds

Atmospheric scattering
    a) Rayleigh Scattering: Gas molecules; d < (1/10)λ
    b) Mie Scattering: smoke, dust; λ >= d > (1/10)λ
    c) Non-selective Scattering: Water vapour d > λ

Temperature Vs Heat:
    Temperature: measure of the average energy of molecular motion in a substance (a measurement)
    Heat: kinetic energy transferred from one body to another (is energy)

Heat Transmission
    - Convection: transfers by circulation or mass movement; atoms free to move
    - Conduction: transfers if in contact or collisions; heat flows from higher to lower temperature
    - Radiation: transfers if not in contact;

Albedo: Reflectivity of a surface, depends on brightness and texture
    higher aerosols = higher albedo
